# Uncovering Patterns of Hate: An Exploratory Analysis of U.S. Hate Crime Data (1991â€“2023)
##### Author: Sujin Kim

This project analyzes long-term trends in hate crimes across the United States using publicly available data from the FBI Crime Data Explorer. It was developed as part of a graduate course assignment on data exploration at Johns Hopkins University.
